## Overview of Project:

Pyper gave our team the task of this project to provide a data frame that visualized the provided data. This project was broken down into very simple categories. Rural, Suburban, and Urban with categories for Total Rides, TOtal Drivers, Total Fare, and so on. with this deep review of data we were able to give Pypers team amazing feedback on how to improve their company as well insight to how things are moving along. 

## Results: 



Our team reviewed the data set with extensive eyes to make the best summer recommendations later on using the information provided below. It is noted that Urban had the highest set of drivers; to no surprise, the total fare average at the highest. At the start contract, suburban drivers' fare per driver came at a staggering 39.50. And lately, the most surprising royal fare per driver was a high of 55.49 dollars. Reviewing this data set, one could conclude that the total fare average per ride and fares came in at the lowest. Our team compared Suburban and Urban data. 

```
        Total Rides	    Total Drivers	Total Fares	Average     Fare Per Ride	Average Fare Per Driver
Rural	    125	            78	            $4,327.93	            $34.62              $55.49
Suburban	625	            490	            $19,356.33	            $30.97	            $39.50
Urban	    1,625	        2,405	        $39,854.38	            $24.53	            $16.57

 ## Summary and Recommendations:
 :red_car: :blue_car: :oncoming_automobile: :red_car: :oncoming_automobile: :red_car: :oncoming_automobile: :red_car:

1. After reviewing all the data, one contrast noted in the research is a lower average fare per driver for the urban drivers. I  would recommend that Pyper should work on boosting incentives for growth amongst rural drivers.

2. Potentially, to resolve this issue, we can focus on driving marketing to lower areas to bring revenue in for Pyper by concentrating on growth amongst royal drivers.

3. In contrast, if Pyper took this information and wanted to dissolve trips to royal areas, she could potentially push for more recruitment or incentives to promote more drivers in suburban areas.
